We used LEGO Studio 2.0 to make a 3D model of our robot. This helped us see how all the parts would fit together and let us try out different ideas without needing to rebuild anything physically. It made it easier to plan where to put the motors, sensors, and other pieces. The 3D view also helped us spot mistakes and fix them early. This saved us time and made the building process faster and more organized. It was also helpful for working as a team because we could share the design and work on it together. The model also made it easier to explain our robotâ€™s design to others.

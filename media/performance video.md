In this video, our autonomous robot demonstrates how it navigates an obstacle course using ultrasonic sensors, proportional steering, and the Pixy Cam for detecting colored obstacles. The footage shows smooth path correction, responsive turning, and our improved walling system in real-time. These upgrades work together to create a more reliable and stable robot, ready for competition performance.

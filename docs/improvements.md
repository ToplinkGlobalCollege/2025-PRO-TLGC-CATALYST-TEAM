## Robot Improvements Made in May
We began building the robot’s basic structure and drivetrain. The first version used a large motor for driving, a medium motor for steering, and a color sensor for detecting movement on the mat. Components were placed in standard positions to test basic functionality.
Later in the month, we made design improvements by flipping the large motor closer to the EV3 to make the robot more compact and balanced. We also rotated the EV3 horizontally to allow better wire clearance and easier cable management.

## Robot Improvements Made in June
We enhanced the robot’s design by integrating a front mounted passive walling wheel that rotates freely upon contact with vertical surfaces. This mechanism minimizes friction during wall following maneuvers and serves as a buffer to prevent mechanical strain or damage, particularly to the front mounted Pixy Cam. Additionally, the rear large motor was replaced with a medium motor to reduce overall weight and power consumption, prompting a corresponding modification to the rear wheel configuration for compatibility. The steering assembly was restructured for improved mechanical efficiency, and the color sensor was repositioned to accommodate spatial constraints. These refinements collectively enhanced the robot’s agility, stability, and wall navigation reliability.

## Robot Improvements Made in July 
We improved the robot by replacing the color sensor with a gyro sensor, since the color sensor was often unreliable due to poor lighting and being too dependent on surface color. The gyro sensor provides more accurate and consistent turning. We also enhanced the walling system so it rotates more smoothly and better protects the robot when it gets close to walls, especially shielding the Pixy camera from direct contact. To improve space and wiring, we moved the Pixy camera to the top of the robot, as placing it beside the medium motor made the area too crowded and hard to manage wires. Lastly, we upgraded the rear wheels to a larger size, which gave the robot better traction, more stability, and smoother forward movement on the mat.

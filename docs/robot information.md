# Mobility

## Drive System Used
Our EV3 autonomous car uses a single LEGO Large Motor to drive forward. The motor is connected to the main wheels, providing consistent power and speed for straight movement. Because we only used one motor. The Large Motorâ€™s built in rotation sensor helps us measure how far the car moves, making it easier to control and program. This simple setup keeps the robot lightweight, efficient, and ideal for straightforward autonomous driving.

## Turning Strategy
Our robot uses a front steering mechanism inspired by the rack and pinion system to control its direction. Instead of a full gear rack, we used a half gear piece connected to a beam. When the gear rotates, it pushes the beam side to side, which turns the front wheels left or right. This setup allows the robot to steer smoothly and accurately, making it easier to change direction on the mat. The system provides controlled and stable movement during turns, helping the robot navigate the field more consistently during competitions.

# 1.3 Building Instruction
In this section, the building instructions for the self-driving car can be accessed via the link or QR code below.

# 2.0 Power and Sensor Management
This section covers the power source of the self-driving car and the sensors used to provide it with the necessary information to navigate various challenges. It explains the reasoning behind the selection of each sensor and how they are integrated into the car, along with details on power consumption. A wiring diagram is also included for reference.

# 2.1 Sensors

# 2.2 Wiring Diagram

# 2.3 Building Materials
The following components have been incorporated into the self-driving car to support its core functions and ensure all systems work together effectively.


# 2.4 Power Source
We’ve powered our self-driving car using the EV3 rechargeable battery, which provides a stable energy supply to ensure smooth and consistent operation. This battery serves as the main power source for our robot.

# 3.0 Obstacle Management
In our project, we use the Lego Mindstorms programming language to program the self-driving car. The program is divided into two main parts: the Open Challenge and the Obstacle Challenge. This section includes a flowchart and a summary of the code used for both challenges. Each part is designed to address specific requirements and improve the self-driving cars performance in different scenarios, providing a clear understanding of how the vehicle operates under various conditions.

# 3.1 Open Challenge

# 3.2 Obstacle Challenge

# 4.0 Improvements
This section highlights the challenges faced during the development of our self-driving car and the alternative solutions we explored to improve its performance. By analyzing each issue in detail, we were able to apply enhancements that increased the car’s reliability and overall efficiency.
